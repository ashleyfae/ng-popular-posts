# NG Popular Posts #

Super simple, lightweight WordPress widget that displays the featured images of your most popular posts.

### Show posts within a certain time frame

You can choose to filter the posts by time frame: all time (no filter), last 30 days only, or last 7 days only. This is available in the widget's settings.

### Filters to modify the code

The plugin has a few filters you can use to modify the code:

ng_popular_posts_query_args - Passes in the query arguments in case you want to make adjustments.
ng_featured_image_size - Change the size of the featured image (defaults to "full")
